I'm an iOS engineer based in Berlin. I enjoy designing robust systems using `CLEAN` architecture and working on complex topics. Security is my other hobby. 

Current role: iOS @vivyHealth

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🏗 Building a small corona widget for Montenegro🇲🇪 as a learning project for WidgetKit.
- 🌱 I’m currently looking for a navigation solution to decouple views in SwiftUI without using UIKit
- 💬 Ask me about CLEAN, Swift or anything related to Apple platform dev.
